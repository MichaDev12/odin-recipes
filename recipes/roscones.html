  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is a traditional Colombian sweet bread shaped like a doughnut and filled with guava paste (bocadillo).</p>
  <p>Guava paste is the traditional filling, but there are very good versions with dulce de leche or chocolate.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon icing sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 ½ teaspoons instant yeast</li>
    <li>½ cup guava paste, or to taste</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>½ cup coarse granulated sugar, or as needed</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat milk in the microwave or on the stovetop to 110 degrees F (43 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place warm milk, egg, butter, flour, white sugar, icing sugar, salt, and yeast in a bread machine in the order listed. Run Dough cycle. Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done, about 90 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into 4 or 5 equal parts depending on the size of the roscones you want to make. Take one piece of dough and roll it into a roll about 1/2 inch wide. Repeat with remaining dough. Flatten the rolls and fill evenly with guava paste.</li>
    <li>Roll the dough once again so the filling is in the middle and not seen from the outside. Take both ends and paste them together, forming a circle with a hole in the middle (like a doughnut). Place in an oiled baking pan, leaving room to grow. With a sharp, non-serrated knife, make some slits on the top just deep enough that you can see a bit of the filling.</li>
    <li>Once all your roscones are done, cover and let rest until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Brush beaten eggs over each roscone and sprinkle coarse sugar on top.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack before serving.</li> 
  </ol>
